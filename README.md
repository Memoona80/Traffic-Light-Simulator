# ðŸš¦ Street Light Simulator with Pedestrian Detection

An Arduino-based traffic light simulation for a crossroad.  
When a pedestrian is detected via IR sensor, both North-South and East-West lights turn red until the pedestrian passes.

## ðŸ›  Components Used
- Arduino UNO (powered via 5V)
- 6 LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green Ã— 2 sides)
- IR sensor module
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

## ðŸ“œ How It Works
1. The system cycles through standard traffic light sequences for NS and EW roads.
2. If the IR sensor detects a pedestrian (pencil used in testing), both directions turn red.
3. Once the pedestrian leaves, normal light sequence resumes.
